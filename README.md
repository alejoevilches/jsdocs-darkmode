# jsdocs-darkmode

This is the third challenge of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. It is a technical documentation page of JavaScript. It was made with pure CSS following the guidelines of the certification and, in order to give it some extra value, I used the Material Design colors for a dark mode.
